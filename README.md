This project helps to automating command tools by simulating piped io in process.

# Why this project

Interactive command tools utilize stdin, stdout and stderr for communication.

Sometimes automating is required, and we could use something like TCL Expect to makes this stuff trivial.

With the support from the authors of the tools, automating could be even more trivial.

See [`altio/README.md`](altio/README.md) for more.
